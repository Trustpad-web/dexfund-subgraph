# Dexify Subgraph

The official subgraph (thegraph.com) for Dexify Finance.

## Development

Before you can start developing, you'll need to have [Node.js][node] and [Yarn][yarn] installed.

Installing only takes two commands and you're ready to roll:

```bash
# Install all dependencies.
yarn install

# Generate the subgraph and code.
yarn codegen
```

You are now ready to start development. Documentation is available [here](https://thegraph.com/docs). There are also several helpful scripts in package.json for testing, and deploying the subgraph locally.
